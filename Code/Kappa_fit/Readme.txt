To find the kappa fit, first I perform the chi-square fit as in equation 27 including signal from both WW and ZZ channel. 
Write down the fit coefficients. Then do the same for WW signal only and ZZ signal only
From here the quadratic and cubic coefficients can be found.
To find the cubic coefficient, we perform chi-square fit where both WW and ZZ signal included, but dyt for WW is twice as ZZ
Run kappa-fit.nb and follow the instruction to perform all above
