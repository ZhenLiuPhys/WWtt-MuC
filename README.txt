This repository contains all the code used to generate the plots and figures in arXiv:2308.06323.
All the necessary codes are in the code folder. If you have any questions, please contact: Ishmam Mahbub (mahbu008@umn.edu)
Go to Code/Figure_generator/ and download all files in each folder with appropriate figure number, then run the .nb file to 
reproduce the figures

Codes for electroweak PDF can be found in Code/Electroweak PDF/

Below are some general comments regarding how to generate each figures, more detailed comments can be found in their respective folders:

Fig. 2: Each panel in the figure are generated seperately and combined manually. For example, to generate partonic distribution for
WW>tt, goto Code/Figure_generator/Figure2/WWtt/ and run Plot_partonic.nb. Similarly, for other channels of interest,
run Plot_partonic.nb in their respective folder in Code/Figure_generator/Figure2/

Fig. 3:  Code/Figure_generator/Figure3/3TeV/Plot_Convolute 2.nb for 3 TeV cross-section
         Code/Figure_generator/Figure3/10TeV/Plot_Convolute.nb for 10 TeV cross-section
